# Artix-7 FPGA for RHS Research LiteFury M.2 card
This folder contains a minimal x1 PCIe design for the LiteFury card.  It includes a specially modified compile.tcl that handles the non-standard PCIe lane ordering of this card.

The objective is to run this design on an M.2 to x1 PCIe adapter plugged into the Raspberry Pi CM5 IO board.
