# litefury_pcie
A little project to provide the fpga design for the RHS Research LiteFury M.2 PCIe board.

## Results
The PCIe lanes are wired in a non-standard way on this board. TCL reset_property and set_property commands were added to compile.tcl to handle this.  The resulting design enumerates as a Gen 2 x4 PCIe device when installed in a PC.

## Files
- litefury - a minimal pcie design that enumerates
- clock_reset_test - a tiny design that verifies the pcie reference clock and reset

## Compilation
    cd litefury/implement
    vivado -mode batch -source setup.tcl
    vivado -mode batch -source compile.tcl
    vivado -mode batch -source spi_program.tcl

# Test
I installed the LiteFury onto a very inexpensive four lane PCIe to M.2 adapter to facilitate removal and replacement. The board functions correctly that way.

I also tried a one lane PCIe on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 IO Board. This works well and is something like a low-cost ZynqMP.

The Xilinx PCIe core provies two address regions. The 64KB region is for DMA access. The 1MB region allows random access to the whole address space.
